Until this site is completed, directions regarding how to construct a Peltier-based cloud chamber can be found at:


http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Cloud-Chamber-using-Peltier-Coolers/

  
 For our current model there were some slight differences:
 1. We chose to use a smaller chamber, a petri dish, as this made the vapor cloud more easy to see.
 
 2. We embedded lights into the side of the petri dish, three, rather than mounting them externally. 

 3. Rather than using a sponge to hold the alcohol, we chose to use felt.
 

THINGS TO REMEMBER:
- there needs to be a tight seal between the the Peltier coolers and the heatsink. For this reason we used Arctic Cooler thermal paste however it is important to apply pressure while the paste dries!!
