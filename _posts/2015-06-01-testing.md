> **Step by Step Instructions to Build a Cloud Chamber**

**Insert picture of finished product**

**Step 1:**
 Spray paint the bottom outside of the petri dish lid (the one with the bigger diameter) black and put it to the side to let it dry with the spray painted surface facing up. Place the other part of the petri dish with the surface facing up so that it is not touching anything to aviod getting scratched. 

>**Step 2:**
You have to convert the power supply to a lab bench power supply so that when you press the switch it will turn on. **DO NOT PLUG THE 430 WATT POWER SUPPLY IN.** Cut the mesh wire organizer of the 24 pin connector to be about 3 inches from the opening where the wires come out of the power supply (see Figure 1). It may be easier to cut the wires and mesh wire organizer right after the taped part by the adapter first, and then cut the mesh wire organizer the specified length.

*Figure 1. Diagram of 24-pin connector (figure from [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Computer-Power-Supply-to-Bench-Power-Supply-Adapte/step3/Identify-the-Wires-on-the-20-Pin-or-24-Pin-Connect/))*

**NOTE:**
WHEN SOLDERING/CUTTING/WORKING WITH ANY WIRES **DO NOT** HAVE THE POWER SUPPLY PLUGGED IN.

**Step 3:**
Cut the needed wires (every wire except Yellow Wire 3) of the 24 pin adapter, found in Step 5, the specified lengths and the extra wires to be around the same length as the mesh wire organizer.

>**Step 4:**
You will need 3 yellow wires so cut another mesh wire organizer with a yellow wire in it to be 2 inches from the opening where the wires come out of the power supply. Cut Yellow Wire 3 the specified, found in Step 5. Cut the other wires that are not needed around the same length as the mesh wire organizer.

**Step 5:**
Strip the end of the 5 black wires, 2 yellow wires, 1 red wire, and 1 green wire from the 24 pin adapter from the power supply. Also strip the end of Yellow Wire 3 from the other group of wires in the power supply. Make sure none of the stripped parts of different color wires touch.

The lenghts below are best for the optional mounting that is described at the end of the instructions. If you do not plan to mount the parts of the cloud chamber then you can adjust the wire lengths as you see fit. 

Lengths of each wire (from where they come out of the power supply to before the stripped part of the wire):

* Black wire 1 (connected to the CPU Cooler with 4 pin adapter): 4 1/4 inches
* Black wire 2 (connected to Green Wire 1): Short length that is a little longer than the cut mesh wire organizer (same length as Green Wire 1)
* Black wire 3 (connected to the black wire on the 12710 peltier): 7 inches
* Black wire 4 (connected to the black wire on the 12709 peltier): 7 inches
* Black wire 5 (connected to the black wire on LED strip): 14 1/2 inches (when the black wire from the LED strip is about 5 3/4 inches)
* Yellow Wire 1 (connected to the CPU Cooler with 4 pin adapter): 4 1/4 inches
* Yellow Wire 2 (connected to the red wire on the 12710 peltier): 7 inches
* Yellow Wire 3 (connected to the red wire on LED strip): 12 inches (when the red wire from the LED strip is about 5 3/4 inches)
* Red Wire 1 (connected to the red wire on the 12709 peltier): 7 inches
* Green Wire 1 (connected to black wire 2): Same length as Black Wire 2

>**Step 6:**
From the 24 pin adapter, use electrical tape to group together like colored wires that are not needed (the ones that are not listed in Step 5). Make sure the electrical tape covers the end of the wires where you cut them. 

**Step 7:**
Now use a zip tie to group together all the wires from the 24 pin adapter (wires listed from this adapter in Step 5 and unneeded wires). Tape around the mesh wire organizer, zip ties and wires all together with electrical tape (See Figures 2 and 3).

*Figure 3. Taped wires in mesh wire organizer*

>**Step 8:** 
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 for the other adapter with Yellow Wire 3. 

**Step 9:**
Cut the other mesh wire organizers to be about an inch from the opening where the wires come out of the power supply. 

>**Step 10:**
Cut the wires to be about the same length of the mesh wire organizers and repeat Steps 6 and 7 for the rest of the wire adapters that are not needed. Once you put the tape around each group of unneeded wires, put a zip tie around all of them (look at Figure 4).

*Figure 4. Finished grouping of wires from power supply*

**Step 11: (might not need)**
Solder female wire connectors to the black, red and yellow wires from the power supply and a male wire connector to the green wire from the power supply. Then put electrical tape over each part of the wire connectors that you have soldered the wires to (Look at Figures 5 and 6).

* **NOTE: (might not need)**
Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clwAV3YH9PA) to learn how to solder a wire to a wire connector. Use a soldering stand to hold the wire connector while soldering because the wire connector will become very hot.

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/banana_connector_closeup.jpg)
*Figure 5. Wire connector unconnected. Put the electrical tape around the bottom part of the male connector and then cover the female connector fully, making it a little longer so that it will overlap the electrical tape on the male connector when they are put together. (might not need)*

*Figure 6. Wire connector connected (might not need)*

>**Step 12:**
Connect Green Wire 1 and Black Wire 2 together with the wire connectors. Make sure no other wires are touching different color wires.

**Step 13:**
Plug the power supply in and turn it on to make sure that the fan works. Turn it off and unplug it afterwards.

>**Step 14:**
Solder 2 male wire connectors to the black and red wire on the 12710 peltier. Do the same for the 12709 peltier. Put the electrical tape on them as shown in Figures 5 and 6. 

**Step 15:**
Once the fan works, place the CPU cooler (Cooler Master Hyper D92 or Cooler Master V8 GTS) so that the pipes are on your left and right side and the fan is facing you as you are facing the CPU cooler (see Figure 7).

>**Step 16:**
Put a thin layer of the thermal paste on the top surface of the CPU cooler. The thermal paste should cover the same area that the peltier will cover.

* **NOTE:**
You can squirt the thermal paste onto the surface and then spread with a plastic card/credit card like piece.

>**Step 17:**
Put the 12710 peltier on top of the thermal paste so that the wires are perpendicular to the pipes on the CPU cooler. The red wire on the peltier should be on your right as you are facing it, as shown in Figure 7.

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/peltier_on_cooler.jpg)
*Figure 7. Placement of 12710 peltier on the CPU cooler*

**Step 18:**
Press the peltier down and move it around slightly so that you know it has good contact with the thermal paste.

>**Step 19:**
Connect Yellow Wire 2 (12V) to the red wire on the 12710 peltier and connect Black Wire 3 (ground) to the black wire on the peltier.

**Step 20:**
To test if you put on the peltier correctly, turn on the power source and touch the top of the peltier. If the peltier is hot, unplug it immediately, you have put the peltier on wrong. If it is cold you did it correctly. Unplug the power source. 

>**Step 21:**
To connect the power supply to the CPU Cooler, you should cut 4 half inch (length of part of wire that is not stripped) connector wires that are stripped at both ends. These will connect the two 4 pin adapters from the CPU Cooler to the power supply. Figure 8 shows you where to connect the yellow and black wires in the 4 pin adapters. In the HYPER D92 CPU cooler you will need to solder 2 half inch connector wires to 1 male wire connector to connect to Yellow Wire 1. Then do the same for Black Wire 1 because there are two 4 pin adapters (we suggest using 2 yellow connector wires to connect to Yellow Wire 1 from the power supply and 2 black connector wires to connect to Black Wire 1 from the power supply to make things less confusing).

*Figure 8. Picture of 4 Pin PWM coming from the CPU cooler (figure from [overclock.net](http://www.overclock.net/t/1426034/pwm-fan-headers-fan-xpert-confused))*

**Step 22:**
Turn on the power supply to make sure the fans work on the CPU cooler.

>**Step 23:**
Put a thin layer of thermal paste on the top of the 12710 peltier and place the 12709 peltier on top of it with the red wire on the right side as you are facing it, pushing down on it. The red wire on the 12709 peltier should be on the same side as the red wire on the 12710 peltier.

**Step 24:**
Connect Red Wire 1 (5V) from the power supply to the red wire on the 12709 peltier and connect Black Wire 4 (ground) from the power supply to the black wire on the 12709 peltier. 

>**Step 25:**
To test it, turn on the power supply and touch the top of the peltier. If it is hot unplug it immediately, you have put the peltier on incorrectly. If it is cold you did it correctly. Unplug the power supply.

**Step 26:**
You can contact us **(add link)** to request project panel pieces, or you can cut them yourself. Use a hot wire cutter to cut 3 pieces of project panel to keep the peltier in place on the CPU cooler. Figure 9 shows the dimensions for the project panel.

**Add figure**
*Figure 9. The dimensions of each piece of project panel with the Cooler Master HYPER D92.*

Hot glue the 2 shorter pieces to the longer piece and then lay it around the peltier so that there is an opening for the wires. The project panel should be the same level as the peltiers (look at Figure 10). 

>**Step 27:**
Cut a piece of kapton tape and place it over the peltier to keep the peltier in place. If it is the HYPER D92 CPU cooler you should only use one piece of tape and have it lay perpendicular to the wires from the peltier and wrap it around one of the pipes on each side (shown in Figure 10).

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/peltier_with_thermal_paste.jpg)
*Figure 10. Both peltiers placed on the surface of the CPU cooler with the project panel around it, along with a piece of kapton tape applied over everything.*

**Add picture from downloads**
*Figure 11. This shows how the kapton tape should be applied around the pipes on the CPU cooler.*

**Step 28:**
Apply thermal paste on top of the peltier and kapton tape (this should be thicker than what was previously done).

>**Step 29:**
Put the spray painted lid of the petri dish on top of the peltier with the thermal paste and press down to assure it has good contact (spray painted side has contact with the thermal paste).

**Step 30 (might need to change):**
Trace the top of the petri dish with the smaller diameter onto a piece of felt (best if you get the type of felt that is sticky on one side). When done with the petri dish, place the petri dish so the surface is facing up. This is to ensure that nothing scratches what you will be eventually looking through.

>**Step 31:**
Cut the circle shape of felt about 3mm in from where you traced so that it fits inside the petri dish lid. Once this is cut, lay the petri dish lid face down on a plain piece of paper or a glasses cleaner cloth and make sure the felt circle fits inside.

**Step 32:**
Cut a hole in the center of the felt so that you can make a ring that is about a half of an inch thick **(check measurement)** and attach it to the inside of the lid of the petri dish. When attaching it to the inside of the petri dish, place the petri dish on a cloth or peice of printer paper.

>**Step 33:**
If you have a 3D printer, you can download the stl file **(include link)** or contact us to request to have us send you a LED holder **(include link)**. Once you have the 3D printed LED holder, take the LED strip and wrap it around the inside and mark where it should be cut (on our LED strip from Radio Shack every 3rd LED there was a scissor marker where you could cut so we had 18 LEDs). 
>
>* **NOTE:**
You should put the red and black wires from the LED strip through the small hole from the inside of the LED holder and then wrap it around the inside of the LED holder. 

**include figure 9**
Figure 9. This shows instructions that came with the LED strip from RadioShack on how to connect the LED strip to power if the part with the wires have already been cut off.

**Step 34:**
Cut the LED strip where it is needed and use **(include name of tape)** to attach the LED strip to the inside of the LED holder. We cut the mounting tape down the middle and attaced 4 pieces to the LED strip. Press down on the LED strip when you attach it to the LED holder.

>**Step 35:**
Connect wire connectors to the red and black wires coming from the LED strip once it is secured in the LED holder with the wires already through the wire hole. 

**Step 36:**
Yellow Wire 3 will connect to the red wire from the LED strip and Black Wire 5 will connect to the black wire from the LED strip. 

>**Step 38:**
Make sure all the wires are connected with the wire connectors. If there are any wires that are not covered, put electrical tape on the open parts. Now you can plug in the power supply and turn it on to make sure the fan in the power supply works, fans on the CPU cooler work and the LEDs light. Once everything works, turn the power supply off.

**Step 39:**
Put 1mL of 99% alcohol evenly across the felt ring using an eyedropper.

>**Step 40:**
Take the radioactive source and place it on the bottom inside of the spray painted petri dish and then put the cover with the felt ring over it.

**Step 41:**
Rest the LED holder over the petri dish.

>**Step 42:**
Turn on the power supply, and within a 30-60 seconds you will see the trails, as shown in Figure 12.

**INCLUDE PICTURE OF TRAILS**
Figure 12. Picture of trails.

**The following steps are optional. If you want to mount the materials needed for the cloud chamber and make it look more professional, please continue with the instructions.

>**Step 43:**
Cut the birch plywood **(dimensions)** with a circular saw for a clean cut. 

**NOTE:**
Use a guiding rail and a woodworking square to make a straight cut through the plywood.

>**Step 44:**
Cut the trim into 2 peices that are 11 inches (from inner part to inner part) and 2 peices that are 15 inches (from inner part to inner part) with a miter saw (look at Figure 12). Make sure they fit around the plywood and match up in all four corners. If they do not, adjust and cut/sand accordingly. If there are small gaps in the corners you can use wood filler later on. 

**NOTE:**
It may be best to cut the trim a little bit longer than needed to leave room for error. 

**add figure**
*Figure 13: Dimensions of trim*

**Step 45:**
Now use wood glue to glue the trim on the plywood mounting board. Use a pencil to mark how far the trim overlaps on the plywood and put the glue a little further inside of that line so that there is not a lot of glue that seeps over onto the visable part of the plywood. Once you position the trim around the plywood, if you notice any excess glue use a wet cloth to wipe it off. Place something heavy, like a textbook, over the trim to keep it in place while the glue dries. 

>**Step 46:** 
Once the glue is dry, if wood filler is necessary please apply it to the corners.

**Step 47:**
Use the Template for Mounting the Cloud Chamber **(add link)** to see where to position all the parts of the cloud chamber. Drill 4 holes using a 5/64 inch drill bit for the eye screws first. Then twist in the eye screws.

>**Step 48:**
Place the CPU Cooler in the middle of the 4 eye screws and secure it by using the 10" bungees (shown in Figure 14). The wires coming from the peltiers should be on the opposite side of where the gooseneck will be. 

**add figure from downloads**
*Figure 14. Showing how to mount the bungees*

**Step 49:**
Now place the power supply where shown in the template. The wires from the power supply to the CPU cooler should be on the opposite side of where the gooseneck mount will be placed. Put the 2 mending plates over the top right and bottom left corners of the power supply. Use a pencil to mark where the holes for the bolts should be drilled.

>**Step 50:**
Remove the power supply and CPU cooler and use a ¼ inch drill bit and drill 4 holes for the bolts next to the power supply.

**Step 51:**
Once the holes are drilled, position the CPU cooler and power supply back on the plywood mounting board and put the bolts in from underneath the birch plywood and connect them through the holes on the mending plates with wing nuts.

>**Step 52:**
Put the gooseneck arm and mount together. Twist the LED holder on the gooseneck. It should be snug.

**Step 53:**
Place the gooseneck where it is shown on the template. 

>**Step 54:**
Make sure this is a good spot for the gooseneck to be so that it is easy to place the LED holder around the petri dish on the CPU cooler. 

**Step 55:**
Once you are happy with the placement you can use a pencil to mark where you should drill the holes to mount it with the gooseneck facing the CPU Cooler with the petri dish.

>**Step 56:**
Use a 5/64 inch drill bit to drill the 3 holes for the gooseneck mount.

**Step 57:**
Place the gooseneck where it was positioned before and use a screwdriver to screw in the screws that came with the gooseneck mount to the plywood.

**Step 58:**
Now take everything off the plywood mounting board. Sand the plywood and trim once everything has dried with **(#)** sand paper. 

>**Step 59:**
Stain the plywood and trim and let it dry. We used **(type of stain)** and found it was easiest to apply with a cloth. Follow the instructions for application and how long it should dry that are given on the container of the type of stain you use. 

**Step 60:**
Once it is dry, put finish on over the stain. We used **(type of finish)** and applied it with an all purpose brush. Follow the instructions for application and how long it should dry that are given on the container of the type of finish you use. 

>**Step 61:**
Once the finish has dried, you can sand it again where needed. 

**Step 62:** 
Now mount the CPU Cooler, power supply and gooseneck again like you did before. 

>**Step 63:**
If you have a 3D printer, you can download the stl file **(include link)** for the petri dish lid holder or contact us to request that one be sent to you. Once you have the 3D printed petri dish lid holder, you can use epoxy to mount it on the plywood in the empty space. You can also fill up the empty space with logos like we did. 

**Step 64:**
When the petri dish lid is not being used you can put an eye cleaner cloth inside the petri dish lid holder and place the lid inside the holder. This will help prevent the lid from being scratched.

**include figure 15**
*Figure 15. Petri dish lid being put into lid holder with glasses cleaner cloth*
