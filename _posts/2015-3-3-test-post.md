What is a cloud chamber?

What are cosmic rays?

Why do you care?


When high energy protons strike the upper atmosphere they
decay into particles known as secondary cosmic rays which can 
then be detected on the surface of the Earth. The turn-key cloud 
chamber is an affordable and easily constructed device which 
can be used to visualize the tracks left by these particles. 

Although cosmic rays have been our primary focus thus far,
cloud chambers can be used to view the tracks of any charged particle
which may pass through it, including alpha and beta particles which 
are emitted from radioactive samples. 

There are many types of particle detectors including most popularly semiconductor detectors,scintillators and cloud chambers. Cloud chambers
can be built and maintained rather inexpensively and are therefore a more
reasonable modelfor amatuer particle physic enthusiasts such as myself.

This site contains much of the material which is essential to build,
and understand, a turn-key peltier-based cloud chamber, as well as the code
which was used for our data-logging componenet. 

Here you will find

* The materials needed
* Step by step instructions 
* Code used for the web-cam data- logging component
* Examples of some of the images and videos we acquired of cosmic events


Is this *bold*? no.
