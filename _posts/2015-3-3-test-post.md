What is a cloud chamber?

What are cosmic rays?

Why do you care?


When high energy protons strike the upper atmosphere they
decay into particles known as secondary cosmic rays which can 
then be detected on the surface of the Earth. The turn-key cloud 
chamber is an affordable and easily constructed device which 
can be used to visualize the tracks left by these particles. 
Working from a prototype developed by former Siena research 
students, we have since created a stable and reliable model with 
an additional component: the use of a webcam triggered by 
cosmic rays which can then record the given event.

Is this *bold*? no.
